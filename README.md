# ASSIGNMENT 1

## Algorithms

### 1. Merge Sort
- Splits the array into halves, sorts each half, and merges them.  
- Time complexity: O(n log n)  
- Space complexity: O(n) for temporary arrays.
- 
### 2. Quick Sort
- Chooses a pivot, partitions the array, and sorts the parts recursively.  
- Average time: O(n log n), worst-case: O(n^2)  
- Stack depth is usually O(log n) if you sort smaller partition first.
- 
### 3. Deterministic Select
- Finds the k-th smallest element in the array.  
- Current version sorts the array and picks the k-th element.  
- Optimal Median-of-Medians algorithm can do this in O(n) time.
- 
### 4. Closest Pair of Points
- Finds the pair of points that are closest to each other in 2D.  
- Current implementation checks all pairs (O(n^2)).  
- The classic algorithm can do this in O(n log n) using divide-and-conquer.
